/**
 * Scope + output controls for `getSnapshot`.
 *
 * - `ref` omitted → start at the document root (`config.rootElementName`). With
 *   no `ref` and no `depth` this is the whole document; `ancestors`/`siblings`
 *   are inapplicable (the root has none) and ignored.
 * - `ancestors` → how many ancestor levels to include above `ref` (spine).
 * - `siblings` → also include each ancestor-spine node's siblings, so `ref` is
 *   shown in context up the spine. Implies at least `ancestors: 1`.
 *   `true` → shallow siblings; `{ expand: true }` → keep the siblings' subtrees
 *   (still bounded by `depth`).
 * - `depth` → how many levels to descend below the start (default: whole
 *   subtree). Honored with or without `ref` (e.g. `{ depth: 1 }` = root + its
 *   direct children).
 * - `includeDeleted` → re-attach staged-deleted nodes as `status:'deleted'`
 *   tombstones. Tree output only — XML always reflects what will be written.
 * - `omit` / `unwrap` → tree-shape filters applied to tree output only (shared
 *   with `getTree`). XML always reflects the full, unfiltered document. When
 *   `unwrap` is omitted, the config's transparent elements are unwrapped, so the
 *   snapshot matches what the UI shows.
 * - `as` → `'tree'` (default) | `'xml'` | `'both'`.
